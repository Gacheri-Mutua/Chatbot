# Chatbot
This project demonstrates a **basic rule-based chatbot** that classifies customer questions into categories and returns predefined responses.  

 Features

  - **Billing** (e.g., payment, invoice, charges)
  - **Technical Support** (e.g., errors, issues, not working)
  - **General Inquiry** (e.g., business hours, location, contact)
- Uses **keyword-based classification**.
- Provides **predefined responses** for each category.
- Handles **unknown inputs** gracefully.
- Bonus: Detects negative emotions (e.g., *angry, frustrated*) and suggests escalation to a human agent.
